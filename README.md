Q: Why did the 1.0.9 update take so long?

A: It's because I'm too busy with homework and other projects


Q: Will there be a "HardCore" mod?

A: There is actually a beta version uploaded on CurseForge, you can go and check it out, but I don't really know if I'll ever finish it


Q: SoftCore releases for 1.17.x?

A: Probably I won't, due to the mod being deprecated


Q: SoftCore for fabric?

A: That would be a lot of work, I tried it some time ago, it didn't work, but in the future, maybe there will be an official Fabric port. 


Q: Will you nerf Super Charge? it's too OP

A: Yeah, in 1.0.9 it's nerfed, and probably in 1.1 will be nerfed again


Q: Why did you change the name of the mod?

A: Actually it didn't change, I just added the name of the update, but that's because I found out by mistake that Softcore has another meaning that isn't related to Minecraft, I didn't mean to do THAT, but I thought of that name when I started creating the mod and how no one made a mod called that, I used the name


Q: Your mod doesn't feel like Minecraft, why?

A: I have the same feeling, I think because of some textures, how the structures are generated and how the flowers are generated, maybe the mob models too, lately I've been working on making it have that vanilla feel, maybe that's the 1.1 update, or maybe just a 1.0.9.2
 

Q: How big was supposed the next update to be? 

A: Really big


Q: What are you currently working on?

A: I was working on the 1.1 Update, until MCreator gave me an error that doesn't allow me to, so now I'm working on my new serious proyect; "Bacrian's Infresnalic World"

Q: Can i use your mod in a public modpack? pls

A: Yeah, just be sure to provide credit and a link to the curseforge or mcreator page

Q: Why did you deprecate the mod?

A: Long story short, the mod had too many incompatibilities between versions, and every time the mod was updated, there was more and more chances that something would get messed up once exported, and as you might think of, it really is a pain to see how your mod that's supposed to work without any issues, suddenly gets an error out of nowhere, yet, that doesn't mean SoftCore ends right here, better yet, BIW, as the new project I have been working on, kinda is the successor to SoftCore, trying to replicate the best and undo the worst and remake it in a new and better way for good.
